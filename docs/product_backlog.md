# Product Backlog – Updated Feb 16, 2025

## New Features & User Stories

1. **Rebranding & Content Update**

    - **Description:** Update all references in UI labels, documentation, image assets, and code
      comments to switch from “Insights AI” to “Fashion AI (StyleScanner).”
    - **Priority:** High
    - **Status:** In Progress
    - **Notes:** This touches README, landing page copy, and any user-facing text. Ensure
      consistency across the project.

2. **Modularization of the Frontend (React Components)**

    - **Description:** Refactor the current static page into a set of reusable, modular React
      components (such as Navbar, Footer, Cards, and the StyleScanner panel).
    - **Priority:** High
    - **Status:** Planned
    - **Notes:** Leverage the existing “src” directory structure to split code logically, improving
      maintainability and scalability.

3. **Progressive Web App (PWA) & Performance Enhancements**

    - **Description:** Integrate techniques like lazy loading, code splitting, and offline support
      (service workers) to enhance performance and resilience.
    - **Priority:** Medium–High
    - **Status:** Planned
    - **Notes:** Review and update the Vite and Docker configurations as needed.

4. **Robust Backend API Development**

    - **Description:** Develop and extend RESTful API endpoints including secure authentication,
      personalized style history, and dynamic styling insights.
    - **Priority:** High
    - **Status:** Planned
    - **Notes:** Focus on security (middleware such as auth.js), error handling, and clear
      separation of concerns between the frontend and backend.

5. **Comprehensive Testing & Quality Assurance**

    - **Description:** Implement frontend testing (Jest, React Testing Library) and set up backend
      tests. Integrate ESLint and Prettier consistently across the codebase.
    - **Priority:** Medium
    - **Status:** Planned
    - **Notes:** This is essential for maintaining code quality as the project scales.

6. **Enhanced Accessibility & Responsive Design**

    - **Description:** Upgrade the UI for improved accessibility with semantic HTML5, ARIA roles,
      and better keyboard navigability; refine responsive breakpoints for all devices.
    - **Priority:** Medium
    - **Status:** Planned
    - **Notes:** Align with updated UX guidelines and design system improvements.

7. **Interactive Onboarding Tutorial**

    - **Description:** Design an interactive guide to assist first-time users in navigating the
      platform and leveraging instant style insights effectively.
    - **Priority:** Medium
    - **Status:** Planned
    - **Notes:** Use user-centric language and guided interactions to showcase key functionalities.

8. **Exploration of Real-Time Feedback Mechanisms**

    - **Description:** Investigate and prototype the use of WebSocket (or similar technologies) for
      delivering real-time style advice and dynamic updates.
    - **Priority:** Low–Medium
    - **Status:** Research
    - **Notes:** This is a longer-term enhancement; initial research and feasibility assessment are
      required.

9. **Internationalization Foundation**

    - **Description:** Lay the groundwork for multi-language support by outlining necessary
      structures and identifying potential libraries.
    - **Priority:** Low
    - **Status:** Backlog
    - **Notes:** Planned for post-core features once the primary functionality is stable.

10. **Unified UI Design System Integration**

    - **Description:** Implement a cohesive visual language using a modern UI kit, standardized
      iconography, and consistent card components that reinforce the brand identity.
    - **Priority:** High
    - **Status:** Planned
    - **Notes:** This should align with the updated brand guidelines and include integration with
      tools like Storybook for component documentation.

11. **Backend Analytics & User Engagement Tracking**

    - **Description:** Integrate analytics to monitor user interactions, track feature usage, and
      gather feedback to support data-driven decisions.
    - **Priority:** Medium
    - **Status:** Planned
    - **Notes:** This will help inform future UI/UX improvements and overall product iterations.

12. **Continuous UI/UX Refinement Based on Feedback**
    - **Description:** Establish a mechanism to continuously collect and analyze in-app user
      feedback for ongoing UI/UX enhancements.
    - **Priority:** Medium
    - **Status:** Ongoing
    - **Notes:** Consider integrating in-app channels and periodic A/B testing to validate
      improvements.

## Updated Priorities for Existing Items

- **Modular Architecture Transition:** Moving from a static page to a modular design is now a top
  priority in order to support robust feature expansion.
- **Backend Enhancements:** Strengthening client-server integration (secure authentication, REST
  endpoints, improved error handling) has been prioritized highly.
- **Design & Visual Consistency:** Unifying the UI design to match the new brand identity is
  critical and has been elevated to high priority.

──────────────────────────────

## Removed / Completed Items

- **Legacy Static Homepage:**
    - The original static homepage design is now considered completed and obsolete. Its
      functionality is being replaced by the modular, component-based architecture.
- **Obsolete “Insights AI” References:**
    - All legacy references to “Insights AI” have been removed or are in the process of being
      updated as part of the rebranding effort.

## Additional Notes & Comments

- Ensure Docker, docker-compose, and build configurations (e.g., Vite, potential integration of
  Webpack or Parcel) are updated in tandem with code changes.
- Consider integrating Storybook to provide a live component showcase, which will help both
  development and future contributions.
- Regular milestone reviews and daily standups should emphasize addressing blockers related to the
  rebranding and modularization tasks.
- Performance monitoring and iterative UI/UX adjustments should be scheduled post-release to quickly
  integrate user feedback.

This backlog reflects the current project state and future vision to evolve StyleScanner.VIP into a
robust, modular, and highly user-centric platform. Team alignment on priorities and clear milestone
planning will be key to successful execution.
