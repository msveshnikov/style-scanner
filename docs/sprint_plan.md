Below is the proposed sprint plan that aligns with the updated product backlog and current project
priorities. This sprint focuses on laying a strong foundation through rebranding, modularization of
the frontend, backend API improvements, UI consistency, and performance and quality enhancements.
The plan is scoped to include seven items.

────────────────────────────── Sprint Plan: Sprint 5 (Feb 17, 2025 – Mar 2, 2025)

──────────────────────────────

1. Sprint Goal ────────────────────────────── • Deliver a consistent, modular, and high-quality
   foundation for StyleScanner.VIP by:  
     – Completing rebranding across all user-facing assets and code/comments  
     – Refactoring the frontend into modular React components  
     – Laying the groundwork for robust backend API endpoints  
     – Integrating a unified UI design system and progress toward PWA enhancements  
     – Improving overall code quality through testing and accessibility enhancements

────────────────────────────── 2. Selected User Stories / Tasks ──────────────────────────────

1. Rebranding & Content Update  
    • Description: Update all references (UI labels, documentation, comments, image assets, landing
   page copy) from “Insights AI” to “Fashion AI (StyleScanner)”.  
    • Priority: High  
    • Estimated Effort: 3 story points  
    • Dependencies / Risks:  
     – Ensure all modules and components are properly identified for text update  
     – Risk of missing legacy text or comments leading to inconsistent branding

2. Modularization of the Frontend (React Components)  
    • Description: Refactor the current static page into a modular structure with reusable
   components (e.g., Navbar, Footer, Cards, StyleScanner panel) within the “src” directory.  
    • Priority: High  
    • Estimated Effort: 8 story points  
    • Dependencies / Risks:  
     – Must finalize component hierarchy and design contracts  
     – Risk of introducing merge conflicts if multiple teams work on overlapping components  
     – Dependent on completed rebranding to update component texts

3. Robust Backend API Development  
    • Description: Develop RESTful endpoints for secure authentication, personalized style history,
   and dynamic styling insights using existing modules (e.g., auth.js, user.js).  
    • Priority: High  
    • Estimated Effort: 8 story points  
    • Dependencies / Risks:  
     – Frontend integration requires clear API contracts (breaking changes may disrupt the UI)  
     – Security considerations (ensure middleware and error handling are robust)

4. Unified UI Design System Integration  
    • Description: Integrate a cohesive visual language via a standardized UI kit and components;
   set up initial Storybook integration for component documentation.  
    • Priority: High  
    • Estimated Effort: 5 story points  
    • Dependencies / Risks:  
     – Dependent on completed modularization for component breakdown  
     – Risk of inconsistent design if design tokens and guidelines are not clearly documented

5. Progressive Web App (PWA) & Performance Enhancements  
    • Description: Introduce performance optimizations (code splitting, lazy loading) and begin
   implementation of offline support via service workers.  
    • Priority: Medium–High  
    • Estimated Effort: 8 story points  
    • Dependencies / Risks:  
     – Requires updates to Vite and Docker configuration  
     – Potential risk with service worker integration causing caching issues if not thoroughly
   tested

6. Comprehensive Testing & Quality Assurance  
    • Description: Implement frontend unit tests (Jest/React Testing Library) and set up backend
   tests along with enforcing ESLint and Prettier standards across both codebases.  
    • Priority: Medium  
    • Estimated Effort: 5 story points  
    • Dependencies / Risks:  
     – Testing frameworks must be integrated into the build pipeline  
     – Risk of insufficient test coverage if not planned properly

7. Enhanced Accessibility & Responsive Design  
    • Description: Upgrade UI components and layout for improved accessibility (semantic HTML5, ARIA
   roles, keyboard navigability) and fine-tune responsive breakpoints.  
    • Priority: Medium  
    • Estimated Effort: 5 story points  
    • Dependencies / Risks:  
     – Must align with the unified UI design system  
     – Risk of inconsistent behavior across devices if responsive breakpoints are not thoroughly
   tested

────────────────────────────── 3. Estimated Total Effort ────────────────────────────── Total Story
Points: 3 + 8 + 8 + 5 + 8 + 5 + 5 = 42 story points  
(Note: Adjust based on team capacity. If 42 SP exceeds capacity for a sprint, consider deferring
lower priority items or breaking tasks into smaller subtasks.)

────────────────────────────── 4. Dependencies and Risks Overview ────────────────────────────── •
Rebranding must be completed before finalizing modular components to avoid rework.  
• Frontend modularization and UI design integration are interdependent—delays in one may affect the
other.  
• Backend API development must align with frontend consumption; ensure clear API contracts are
established.  
• PWA enhancements depend on familiarity with service worker configuration (risk of caching and
offline issues).  
• Testing implementation requires coordination across both frontend and backend changes;
insufficient coverage may hide defects.  
• Accessibility improvements depend on finalized component design and responsive testing across
devices.

────────────────────────────── 5. Definition of Done (DoD) ────────────────────────────── For the
sprint to be considered complete, the following criteria must be met: • All selected tasks have been
implemented and reviewed against acceptance criteria.  
• Rebranding is consistently applied across the UI, documentation, and code comments.  
• Frontend is refactored into modular, reusable React components with corresponding Storybook
documentation.  
• Key backend API endpoints (authentication, style insights, history) are functional, secure, and
integrated.  
• Performance enhancements (lazy loading, code splitting, initial PWA service worker integration)
are in place and verified.  
• A comprehensive suite of tests (unit and integration) is passing, and ESLint/Prettier linting
rules are enforced.  
• Accessibility and responsiveness improvements are validated on multiple devices and with automated
accessibility tools.  
• All changes are merged into the development branch and documented in the project wiki/README where
applicable.

────────────────────────────── This sprint plan provides a clear focus on foundational improvements,
setting the stage for subsequent sprints to iterate on user feedback and long-term features such as
real-time updates and internationalization.

Please review and adjust based on team capacity and evolving project dynamics.
